RULES + How to Play the game:

Objective:
Be the first player to reach 5,000 points by rolling dice combinations that score points.

Setup:

Each player takes turns rolling six dice.
A player must set aside at least one scoring die after each roll. The remaining dice can be rerolled to try and score more points.
Scoring:

Single 1: 100 points
Single 5: 50 points
Three 1s: 1,000 points
Three 2s: 200 points
Three 3s: 300 points
Three 4s: 400 points
Three 5s: 500 points
Three 6s: 600 points
Four of a kind (any number): 1,000 points
Five of a kind (any number): 2,000 points
Six of a kind (any number): 3,000 points
Straight (1-2-3-4-5-6): 1,500 points
Three pairs: 1,500 points
Four of a kind + pair: 1,500 points
Two triplets: 2,500 points
Farkle:
If none of the dice rolled score, the player "Farkles" and scores zero points for that turn. The next player then takes their turn.

Banking Points:
After each roll, a player may choose to "bank" their accumulated points, ending their turn. If a player rolls all six dice and scores with all of them, they may continue their turn by rolling all six dice again.

Winning the Game:
The first player to reach or exceed 5,000 points wins. If multiple players exceed 5,000 points in the same round, the highest score wins.
